            <p>The Naval Dental Clinic has served its community for over six decades, offering patient-centered care grounded in family tradition, professional excellence, and continuity across generations. Today, the clinic is managed by Dr. Xavier Naval, her son, who also holds a full-time post at Rizal Medical Center and attends to clinic patients by appointment. The practice now proudly welcomes its third generation, as Dr. Xavier’s daughter—currently a 2nd-year Dentistry student at Centro Escolar University—is preparing to carry on the family legacy. </p>
